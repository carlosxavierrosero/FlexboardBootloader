 Software that enable the configuration for descriptors and the installations inf files
 necessary for uC PIC 18F4x5x enumerations and run transference across universal   serial bus (USB)
 
there is two transference types: general propose using mpusbapi.dll with installer file  mchpusb.inf and RS-232 Emulation serial through CDC class with installer file mchpcdc.inf

 the other side uC PIC programming, both using code that provide PIC C Compiler CCS.
 with file usb_desc_scope.h and usb_desc_cdc.h respectively.
 
 the idea is change data user as such name device, manufacturer, vendor ID, product ID, so forth and the software modify datas in files mentioned.
